     <h1>Protecting Animals And The Land</h1>
     <p>by Joshua chang</p>
    <p>Lots of animals are closing to extinction, and people are polluting the 
    earth, what should we do? We will try to stop people from killing animals 
    and also protect the whole earth.</p>
    <p>When you are trying to protect animals, try to find the animal that you are 
    trying to protect. Next, you have to observe what habitat the animal lives in. 
    Then you have to add some useful resources to the habitat that can help the 
    animal. For example, if I want to protect pandas, I can plant some bamboos to 
    help the pandas.</p>
    <p>Now we have to talk about stopping land pollution. Try to reduce the waste 
    you have, and remember to throw your own trash away, never throw it on to the 
    floor. You know the three Rs, reduse reuse, and recycle? They are the three main 
    key words that are about stopping land pollution. Reduce means to make lesser of 
    the waste you want to get rid of. Reuse means to use the object that you don't 
    need again and again, like reusing a card board box and using it to make 
    art and crafts. Recycle means to make the object that you no longer need and making
    them into other useful objects, for example, using old news papers into brand new 
    pieces of paper. That is why you always see recycling bins along the streets 
    outside. There are three bins, one is for recycling, while the second one is for
    raw materials and the last bin is for other wastes. The recycling bin should 
    contain papers, plastic and other objects that can be recycled. The raw material
    bin should contain wood, metals, and sand. Raw materials are objects that can 
    be used to make buildings and houses. The last bin should contain food, banana
    peels, and other wet objects that can't be recycled. There are bins every where
    people should throw their trash in the correct bins. Next time when you see a 
    piece of trash on the ground, just pick it up and throw it in the bins. Every one
    has a part to do that can make the whole world clean.</p>
    <p>I Hope that this could make the world a better place to live in.</p>
